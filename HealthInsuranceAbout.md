# Hospital Management System

## HMO: Health Maintenance Organization
HMO plans are the most restrictive type of plan when it comes to accessing your network of providers. If you have an HMO plan, you’ll be asked to choose a primary care physician (PCP) that is in-network. All of your care will be coordinated by your PCP, and you’ll need a referral from your PCP to see a specialist. HMOs do not cover any out-of-network health care costs.

HMO plans typically have cheaper premiums than other types of private health insurance plans.

## PPO: Preferred Provider Organization
PPO plans are the least restrictive type of plan when it comes to accessing your network of providers and getting care from outside the plan’s network. Typically, you have the option between choosing between an in-network doctor, who can you see at a lower cost, or an out-of-network doctor at a higher cost. You do not need a referral to see a specialist, though you may still choose a primary care physician (some states, like California, may require that you have a primary care physician).

PPO plans typically have more expensive premiums than other types of private health insurance plans.

## EPO: Exclusive Provider Organization
EPO plans are a mix between HMO plans and PPO plans. EPO plans give you the option of seeing a specialist without a referral. However, EPO plans do not cover out-of-network physicians.

EPO plans typically have more expensive premiums than HMOs, but less expensive premiums than PPOs.

## POS: Point of Service
POS plans are another hybrid of HMO and PPO plans. You’ll have a primary care provider on an HMO-style network that can coordinate your care. You’ll also have access to a PPO-style network with out-of-network options (albeit at a higher cost). The HMO network will be more affordable, and you will need to get a referral to see HMO specialists.

POS plans typically have more expensive premiums than pure HMOs, but less expensive premiums than PPOs.

## Metal Tiers
Remember earlier when we talked about how all health insurance plans split some of the costs between the insurer and the consumer? Metal tiers are a quick way to categorize plans based on what that split is.

Some people get confused because they think metal tiers describe the quality of the plan or the quality of the service they’ll receive, which isn’t true.

Here’s how health insurance plans roughly split the costs, organized by metal tier:

Bronze – 40% consumer / 60% insurer
Silver – 30% consumer / 70% insurer
Gold – 20% consumer / 80% insurer
Platinum – 10% consumer / 90% insurer

These are high-level numbers across the entirety of the plan, taking into account the deductible, coinsurance, and copayments, as dictated by the specific structure of the plan, based on the expected average use of the plan. These percentages do not take premiums into account. They also do not represent the exact amount that you’ll actually pay for medical services.

In general, Bronze plans have the lowest monthly premiums and Platinum have the highest, with Silver and Gold occupying the price points in between. As you can see from the cost-sharing split above, Bronze plan premiums are cheaper because the consumer pays more out of pocket for health care services. If you frequently utilize health care services, you’ll probably end up paying more out-of-pocket if you choose a Bronze plan, even though it has a lower premium.

If you qualify, you can use a health insurance premium subsidy to help you afford a plan in a higher tier, ultimately saving you money.

There’s a fifth category of health insurance plans that you may see on the marketplace, called “catastrophic” plans. Catastrophic plans have very high deductibles – often, the deductible is the same as the out-of-pocket max – which means they’re really only useful for preventing an accident or serious illness from causing you to go into severe debt. Catastrophic plans are only available for people under 30 or people with a hardship exemption. You cannot use a subsidy on catastrophic plan premiums, but, for years during which the health insurance mandate was active, catastrophic plans did count as qualifying health care.

## Key features that decide how much you pay

## Premium
It’s easy to think of your premium as your monthly bill. Every month, you pay a premium to a health insurance company in order to access a health insurance plan. As we’ll get into in a second, while your monthly premium may be how much you pay for health insurance, it’s not equivalent to how much you pay on health care services. In fact, choosing a plan with lower premiums will likely mean that you’ll pay more out-of-pocket if you need to see a doctor.

## Deductible
A deductible is how much you need to pay for health care services out-of-pocket before your health insurance kicks in. In most plans, once you pay your deductible, you'll still need to pay copays and coinsurance until you hit the out-of-pocket max, after which the plan pays for 100% of services. Plans with lower premiums tend to have higher deductibles.

Note that the deductible and out-of-pocket maximum describe two different concepts: the deductible is how much you’ll pay for a covered procedure before your insurance starts to pay, and the out-of-pocket maximum is the total amount you’ll pay for care including the deductible.

## Copayment
A copayment, often shortened to just “copay,” is a fixed amount that you pay for a specific service or prescription medication. Copayments are one of the ways that health insurers will split costs with you after you hit your deductible. In addition to that, you may have copayments on specific services before you hit your deductible. For example, many health insurance plans will have copayments for doctor’s visits and prescription drugs before you hit your deductible. You will pay copayments until you hit your maximum out-of-pocket amount.

## How much should a health insurance plan cost?
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, there are only five factors that go into setting your premium:

1. Your age
2. Your location
3. Whether or not you use tobacco
4. Individual v.s. a family plan
5. Your plan category (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, or Catastrophic)

Health insurance companies are not allowed to take your gender or your current or past health history into account when setting your premium.

Health insurance premiums on the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces have increased steadily due to many different circumstances, including political uncertainty as well as the cost of doing business. Additionally, while average premiums for the benchmark second-lowest-cost Silver plan will fall slightly in 2020, costs vary widely by state and insurance market.

Over 9 million people who got health care through marketplaces received tax credit subsidies in 2019, further reducing the actual cost of health insurance.

** When it comes to buying a health insurance plan, however, you need to look at more than just the monthly premium. As we mentioned in the sections above, health insurance is only one part of your total spending on health care services. In fact, if you frequently visit a doctor and you buy a plan with a high deductible and low monthly premium, it’s likely that you’ll spend more money overall than if you bought a plan with higher premiums, a lower deductible, and lower copayments and coinsurance payments.

A premium tax credit may help you afford the right health insurance plan for you. A premium tax credit is a tax credit that you can apply in advance of your tax return in order to reduce the cost of your monthly premiums. You can also take the tax credit when you file your yearly tax return. Tax credits are only available to individuals and families within a certain income range – between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line in your state.

Premium tax credits are only available on marketplace plans and cannot be used on public health insurance plans, catastrophic health insurance plans, or off-exchange private health insurance plans.

## How to find an affordable health insurance plan
Finding a health insurance plan that fits you and your needs doesn’t have to be a pain. When shopping for an affordable health insurance plan, it’s important to know what makes a plan affordable to you, specifically. Do you rarely utilize health care services? A high deductible, low premium plan probably makes sense for you. Are you managing a chronic illness? A health insurance plan that has higher premiums, but has lower out-of-pocket costs, will probably be more affordable in the long run.
